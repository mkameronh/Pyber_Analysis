# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the new analysis was to compare the averge weekly fare by city type and to use that information to make business suggestions to the CEO to on how they can use this information to better their business and also look at trends.
## Results:
The below line graph shows the trend of weekly fare totals for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural), from January through April.

By looking at this graph,  you can see the 'Urban' city types have significantly higher weekly fare totals. The obvious reason for that would be that Urban areas are more heavily populated than Suburban or Rural. 

The chart below gives us a summary of each city type in the following categories: Total Rides,	Total Drivers,	Total Fares,	Average Fare per Ride,	Average Fare per Driver.
Looking at this we can see that Urban cities have lower average fares per ride, but when we looked at the graph above, they had the highest total fare amount. This tells us that as the quantitiy of rides increases, the average fare price decreases. This is good for the consumers in Urban areas, but as you can also see the average fare per driver decreases significantly. There are also over 30 times the amount of drivers in Urban areas than there are rural. That is also another reason the average fare per driver is lower because there is a surplus of drivers. There are 2,405 drivers and only 1,625 rides and this could be one of the causes for an average driver fair 1/3 that of rural drivers. The higher fares in rural and suburban areas could indicate that there is an increasing demand for drivers.

## Summary: 
A recommendation I would give to the CEO would be to increase the amount of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas. It seems like there is an increased demand for rides in those areas which is ultimately drivng up the average fare per ride. If there was a sufficient amount of drivers, customers would not have to pay as much per ride and would probably be willing to use the rideshare more often ultimately increasing revenue. Another recommendation I would make would be to evaluate the way total fares are calculated. I think the increase in prices in rural/suburban areas could be because of the distance being traveled compared to urban areas. If the fare prices are calculated by miles, that could be why the prices are significantly higher in rural areas which creates a disparity among rural citizens. The last recommendation I would make would be to get a more standard fare per driver. Suburgan drivers seem to have more of a centered average far per driver. If we could raise the amount urban drivers make, and lower the amount that rural drivers make, there would be less disparity among the drivers in each city type.
